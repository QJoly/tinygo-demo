# TinyGO 

> TinyGo is a project to bring the Go programming language to microcontrollers and modern web browsers by creating a new compiler based on LLVM. You can compile and run TinyGo programs on several different microcontroller boards such as the Raspberry Pico or ESP32.

This repo contains demos and examples for TinyGo using a Raspberry Pi Pico. *(Since compatibility with ESP32 is still in development)*
